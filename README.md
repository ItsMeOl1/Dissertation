# Just Another Tower Defence

## Installation

This Project is run in python 3

Because of this python 3 will need to be installed to run this

This project also uses the Pygame and HeapQ libraries

HeapQ is automatically installed with python 3, but Pygame will need to be added with [`pip install pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/)

## What is Just Another Tower Defence?

Just Another Tower Defence (or JATD for short) is my university dissertation project, in which I have made this game

In this game you must fend off wave after wave of enemies to protect your home town

This is done by fortifying with walls and placing towers to fight for you
